# RAWHTMLAutoresponders
Script to send POST request using Raw HTML Autoresponders API like Aweber, MailChimp, ActiveCampaign etc.

This is a simple script to make a POST request to some Autoresponders. Some autoresponders already provide the API, but mostly they also provide Raw HTML than can be copy pasted to the site directly. This script will extract some information like API endpoint, field name that visible and also hidden.

## Sample
There are some sample for some autoresponder Raw HTML form.
* rawhtmlform_aweber.txt
* rawhtmlform_activecampaign.txt
* rawhtmlform_getresponse.txt
* rawhtmlform_madmimi.txt
* rawhtmlform_mailchimp.txt

## Note
For some autoresponder that uses random generated strings as the field names, this script could not extract that!

## Implementation
I use this script in one of my project intelliplayer.com.
