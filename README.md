# RAWHTMLAutoresponders
Script to send POST request using Raw HTML Autoresponders API like Aweber, MailChimp, ActiveCampaign etc.

This is a simple script to make a POST request to some Autoresponders. Some autoresponders already provide the API, but mostly they also provide Raw HTML than can be copy pasted to the site directly.
